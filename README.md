# wallpaper-playlist
A tool to create, maintain, and run desktop wallpaper playlists from a local collection

Currently I'm thinking the best way to go forward is to have this run in the background, occasionally feeding Variety new papers. This lets me take advantage of some of the cool things in the variety indicator. 
Problems with this:
	No way to fave/unfave papers from Variety
	skipping in variety might be difficult to read because the history doesn't keep timestamps
Solutions:
	forget skipping, that's just a workaround anyway
	fave/unfave from the command line (or a variety plugin?)
